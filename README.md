# IsingModel

Download the annotated image and the dataset. Then download the IsingModel jupyter notebook as well. Make sure they are all in the correct directories. Running the code is quite easy, run all the cells. Halfway the code, there is a parameter section. It contains the different parameters that we varied for our experiments.
